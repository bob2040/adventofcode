2021 Day9 Part2 is a difficult one for me. 08/01/2022

2021 Day9 Part2:
I have passed all tests,but the running result is incorrect using puzzle input data.
My result is 351900.After submitting it,it told me the result was too low.
I have checked my program many times,no problems!I don't know why!....... 08/05/2022

2021 Day9 Part2 has been done.It took me a long time.
I misunderstood part2,for all my thoughts were based on LOW POINTS before. 08/08/2022

I'm still working on 2021 Day 12,complicated one to me. 29/08/2022
